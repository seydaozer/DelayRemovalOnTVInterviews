Delay Removal on Television Interviews - CSE495 Graduation Project â€“ 1 

Delays can occur in TV interviews. When studio presenter questions a remote interviewee, they cannot hear each other in real time. 
The aim of this project is to remove these delays. The audience should watch the video as if there were no delays and should not be aware of the delays.
